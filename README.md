# hello-world
My very first repository! Someday using Git will be second nature :)

And because I'm practicing creating branches and making edits, I'll tell you a bit about me! I write horror, fantasy and sci-fi, and have published several short stories in anthologies. Still working on getting a novel published. As you may have guessed, writing fiction can't always be you're main source of income, so I'm pursuing another interest and working on learning to code for fun and profit. My big goal is to find ways to synthesize my loves for writing, psychology and tech into cool games and mobile apps that others will enjoy.
